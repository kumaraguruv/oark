Our Philosophy:
  * The project is not for sale **NEVER**.
  * Our License is [http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php MIT](.md) you can do anything with the code for your personal/private product/project ...
  * Of course, you can hire us and we can:
    * if you want a special public version with features that we dont want: if we are not agree with your new features, no problem, we can create a new public branch for you in the project.
    * Code a private version for you. BUT there are rules:
      * Only we code a private code if we dont want include in the future the new features. We dont want **NEVER** limit the future of the project with this kind of hire.
    * Trainings: project, rootkits, anything related to the project...
    * Automation stuff: maybe you have for example a sandbox and you want add some automation with the project.
  * If you want a new feature which is good for the project, no problem: you can make a donation and we will try do your features as soon as possible.
  * Of course new developers of companies interesting in our project, are wellcome BUT there are rules:
    * If you want features for your product/company that we dont want, we can create a new branch for you, but you **always must collaborate** with the official project. Please: do not try to change the direction of the project.
  * Donations are wellcome, but if you want a feature that we dont want, only if the donation is good for us: we can create a special branch for you (if the donation is less, bad lucky, please ask before donating if you want new features).
